# My Own MarkDown Cheat-Sheet
## How to create headings

To create a heading we need to start a line with # followed by a space. Sub-heading can be 
created by using two hashes, eg. ## Several levels of headings can be created by adding more hashes.

To start a new paragraph we need to press enter twice.

To italisize text we add asterisk on each side of the text, for example, *this text should be italisized*

By adding two asterisks on each side the text willbe renedered as bold: **This text should be bold**

***By adding three asterisks on each side of the text, the text will be displayed as bold and italisized***
